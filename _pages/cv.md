Education
=========

- **Ph.D. in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Machine Learning Track)**  
  Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA  
  *Aug. 2023 – May 2027 (expected)*

- **M.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics**  
  University of Chicago, Chicago, IL  
  *2021*

- **B.S. in Mathematics (Probability & Statistics)**  
  University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA  
  *2018*

Research Interest
===============
My general research interests include LLM reasoning and understanding the fundamental abilities of LLMs. Specifically, first, I study the inference dynamics of Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), developing decoding methods that leverage planning tokens and other internal signals to improve efficiency and controllability. Second, I explore LLMs for real-world decision-making—for example, in optimization—building systems that orchestrate large-scale workflows.

Honors & Awards
===============

- George Nemhauser Fellowship, Georgia Tech
