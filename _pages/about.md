I am a PhD student in the **Machine Learning track** of the H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, advised by **Pascal Van Hentenryck**.

My research focuses on machine learning for Diffussion large language models(DLLM), Agentic AI, numerical optimization(neural proxies solvers) and trustworthy AI(particularly conformal prediction). I am also interested in general LLM research.

Previously, I received my **M.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics** from the **University of Chicago** and my **B.S. in Mathematics (Probability & Statistics)** from the **University of California, San Diego**. I have worked as a research intern at **Argonne National Laboratory** (secure federated learning and privacy attacks) and as a quantitative intern at **Northeast Securities**.
